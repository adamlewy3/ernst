### Welcome to Ernst!

This is a very work in progress python package for algebra, number theory and geometry. Progress will be slow.

#### To-Do List:
- Chinese Remainder Theorem calculator
- Solving linear congruences 
- Solving x^n \equiv a (p) 
- Extensions of QQ, and GF (including numberfields)
- Class hierarchy, have a 'ring' category, then integral domain, then field category, for instance.
- Ideals of PID's


#### Wish-List
- Fast Polynomial Multiplication
- Make GF come with a generator
- Quotient Rings
- Legendre Symbol
- Matrix Class

#### Done:
- Polynomial Division in Rings (Still needs some final touches)
